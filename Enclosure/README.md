# Fiber Laser Enclosure

My workplace purchased a new fiber laser. We settled on the [Omtech FM7979-50S](https://omtechlaser.com/products/50w-fmm-5rw2-us) as the laser to purchase.  I was suprised to find that there was no enclosure or real safety considerations outside of laser safety glasses.

Since we would be using this laser in a commercial production capacity, that was a no go for us.

So after some research and planning I constructed a removable enclosure based on [JefferyJ's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igLP-VSrQdA).
